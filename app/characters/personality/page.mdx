# ðŸ™‰ Personality

<Callout type="warning">
    Personality is **included** in the character's memory.
</Callout>

Personality defines who the character isâ€”core traits, values, flaws, motivations, biases, humor level, and mannerisms, etc.

A good Personality block gives the model a stable voice (word choice, rhythm, attitude), consistent viewpoints, and predictable reactions under stress or surprise. It should be specific enough to differentiate the character from others.

- **Style:** Personality can be written as quick tags for fast scanning, such as `#Warm #Curious #BluntHumor #Bookish #LowSelfEsteem #Loyal #HatesSmallTalk`, or as natural language for nuance, e.g. `Soft-spoken, academically minded librarian who overexplains when nervous; cares deeply about fairness, deflects praise with self-deprecation, prefers ethics and literature to gossip, avoids violent topics, and warms up after a few exchanges.`
- **Impact:** A well-defined personality ensures the characterâ€™s voice, tone, and reactions remain consistent, naturally guiding topic choices, shaping decision-making, and creating an emotionally believable presence that deepens immersion and fosters user attachment.
