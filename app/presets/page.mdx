# 🧑‍🍳 What is preset

In MATE.AI, presets determine the style and quality of the AI's output. Presets consist of two parts:

- **<Link href='/presets/sampler_parameters' className='underline underline-offset-2'>sampler parameters</Link>:** Control the randomness and diversity of the AI's output.

- **<Link href='/presets/prompts' className='underline underline-offset-2'>prompts</Link>:** Directly constrain or guide the AI's content and expression, such as character settings, scene settings, etc.

By adjusting these, you can achieve results that better suit your needs.

Different presets combined with different LLMs will produce different results, which will directly affect the effect, quality and style.
